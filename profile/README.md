## Hi! Welcome to Fiatsend's GitHub! 👋

We are building innovative, decentralized financial solutions for cross-border transactions, enabling users to easily transfer fiat currencies through blockchain technology. By leveraging the power of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs), we’re creating a financial ecosystem that empowers users to take control of their identities and funds. We’re excited to have you with us on this journey!

 ### Where to start? ⬅️

Fiatsend is focused on solving real-world problems with two key components: Fiatsend Wallet and Fiatsend Exchange: 

| [Fiatsend Wallet](https://wallet.fiatsend.com)  | [Fiatsend Exchange](https://fiatsend.com) | 
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| A decentralized wallet that allows users to send and receive fiat currencies using blockchain technologies. It's built on Web5 and utilizes self-sovereign identity principles. Check out our [Getting Started](https://github.com/fiatsend/web-wallet/GETTING_STARTED.md) Guide to learn how to integrate the wallet into your app.  | A decentralized exchange where users can convert fiat to cryptocurrency seamlessly and perform cross-border transfers. Check out our [Exchange Overview](https://github.com/fiatsend/web-wallet/GETTING_STARTED.md) to dive into the exchange functionalities. |
Components: Fiatsend Wallet API, Decentralized Identifiers, Verifiable Credentials, Self-Sovereign Identity | Components: Fiatsend Exchange API, Liquidity Pools, Cross-border Exchange Module | 

We are constantly iterating and improving Fiatsend. Here are some features we are currently working on:
